Hi! I am Vincenzo Messina and I am a Research Associate and Doctoral Candidate of the Chair of Spacecraft Systems at the Technical University of Munich!
My research focuses on proposing and analysing methods for optimizing decentralized satellite operations in distributed satellite systems (DSS), enabling satellites to make decisions while ensuring consensus across the network, focusing on the strategic exchange of observational tasks among satellites.

I am working now to develop my first website, so it is still a bit rudimental, sorry for that!
